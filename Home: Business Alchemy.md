<h2 id="new-starts-risk-failure--success">New Starts: Risk, Failure &amp; Success</h2>
<p>Risk is “exposure to harm”.<br>
Business is “taking on risk in hopes of gain”.<br>
All too many people take on risk focusing far too much on that gain, discounting the harm to near impossibility.<br>
If success was as easy as accepting risk, we’d all be millionaires and failures would be few.<br>
The fact is that failure is much more likely than success.<br>
This is true at almost any phase of a project but many times more so for new starts.</p>
<h2 id="secrets-of-success">7 Secrets of Success</h2>
<p>Successful startups or product launches have elements in common; a dedicated and expert team, focus on what’s actually important, hard and consistently delivered work, and faith are often seen among them.<br>
What we rarely talk about is that luck, plain old dumb fucking luck is the most important.<br>
True, that sucks.<br>
You can help increase your chances of luck but there are no best practices, no lists of “7 secrets”, and no expertise you can rely on.<br>
Sometimes the best project fails because a message got lost and a crap one wins because of a chance meeting on the street.<br>
As real-estate professional say when asked about the key factors that in pricing a property, “Location, location, location”, among the “7 secrets of success” you’d find “luck” at least four times - probably all 7.<br>
Again, is success really was a matter of doing the right stuff, simply a series of milestones to be checked off a list most endeavors would succeed and no one would brag about them.<br>
Success would be common.</p>
<h2 id="succeeding-failure-to-fail">Succeeding: “Failure to Fail”</h2>
<p>In business, harm can come from any direction and often comes from unexpected ones.<br>
Many of these harms can be fatal for the project. Identifying as many risk factors as possible and planning reduction &amp; mitigation steps is probably the only “secret” we can really claim.<br>
Good project managers do exactly that.<br>
The problem is that most risks can’t be quantified or handled usefully on a spreadsheet.<br>
For those we need “an art” rather than an analytical approach.</p>

#The Business Bastard
##The Service
* And examination and analysis of a project seeking weak points and poorly mitigated risk.

##Core Product

* Optional 1 day follow up workshop to sketch out continuation given the issues raised in the first 2 days.

##Key Focal Points
* Team
* Strategy
* Experience Design
* Product Need & Market Fit
* Competitive Landscape
* Core Business Handling
* Non-Core Business Needs Handling



###Team
A team is no only a group of people who work together but more importantly, a group which exploits each individuals talents for the benefit of their group goals, can rely on each other, and perhaps most importantly have a strong faith and sense of mission in common.

###Strategy
A single person can have a strategy in her head. A tightly knit team can as well with just little loss of value.
The bigger the team and or the less tight they are the more important a written documents is.
I'm not so concerned with the format as with key inclusions and how effectively it serves its purpose.

###Experience Design
No matter what the product is it will be people who use it and before that, people who decode to adopts and maybe buy it.
The project may also be dependent on several user groups in addition to customers/users such as suppliers, investors, and journalists.
A project can outsource graphics, UI and/or web design, and even product design but needs to own the experience positioning.

###Product Need & Market Fit
Webvan was a brilliant product extremely well design and a project that attracted a huge amount of funding.
It failed because of a poor fit with a market that simply wasn't mature enough to use it.

###Competitive Landscape
Similar offerings aren't the only competition. Especially for new product categories the biggest competitor is "nothing", people carrying on as they always have.

###Core Business Handling
Obviously core business is important and most projects are fully aware of this. Exactly how the team communicate and verify requirements, keep to schedules, and communicate out to stakeholder groups can be vital.

###Non-core Business Needs Handling
No startups and few projects even in government or corporate environments have teams of experts in all the necessary but peripheral, support areas such as legal, accounting, or office management. Most projects quickly grow into needing these functions handled.

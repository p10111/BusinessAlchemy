## New Starts: Risk, Failure & Success
Risk is "exposure to harm". 
Business is "taking on risk in hopes of gain". 
All too many people take on risk focusing far too much on that gain, discounting the harm to near impossibility. 
If success was as easy as accepting risk, we'd all be millionaires and failures would be few.

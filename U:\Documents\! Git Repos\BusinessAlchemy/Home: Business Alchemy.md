## New Starts: Risk, Failure & Success
Risk is "exposure to harm". 
Business is "taking on risk in hopes of gain". 
All too many people take on risk focusing far too much on that gain, discounting the harm to near impossibility. 
If success was as easy as accepting risk, we'd all be millionaires and failures would be few. 
The fact is that failure is much more likely than success.
This is true at almost any phase of a project but many times more so for new starts.

## 7 Secrets of Success
Successful startups or product launches have elements in common; a dedicated and expert team, focus on what's actually important, hard and consistently delivered work, and faith are often seen among them. 
What we rarely talk about is that luck, plain old dumb fucking luck is the most important.
True, that sucks. 
You can help increase your chances of luck but there are no best practices, no lists of "7 secrets", and no expertise you can rely on.
Sometimes the best project fails because a message got lost and a crap one wins because of a chance meeting on the street.
As real-estate professional say when asked about the key factors that in pricing a property, "Location, location, location", among the "7 secrets of success" you'd find "luck" at least four times - probably all 7.
